     * returns the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 in the format:
     * "roots are r1 and r2"
     * (where r1 >= r2)
     * Round the roots to one decimal place.
     * You may only use arithemetic operations and type casting for the rounding.
     * You may NOT use any rounding function, such as Math.round() nor 
     * String.format() nor the BigDecimal class, for example. 
     * HINT: For example, if r1 = 3.1415 then r1 + 0.05 = 3.1915
     * Notice how the tenths place stays where it should.
     * If r1 = 3.1515 then r1 + 0.05 = 3.2015 and the tenths place
     * appropriately adjusts. We are not done however. We need to 
     * get rid of all the other digits past the tenths place.
     * Think about how you might use multiplication, division,
     * and/or type casting to accomplish this. 
     * 
     * if the roots are non-real, returns "no real roots"
     * 
     * precondition: a is non-zero
